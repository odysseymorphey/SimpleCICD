## Part 3. Bonus. Implementation of some grep utility flags

Bonus assignment for extra points. You need to develop the grep utility:
- Support of all flags, including: `-h`, `-s`, `-f`, `-o`
- Only pcre or regex libraries can be used for regular expressions












- The source, header and make files must be placed in the src/grep/ directory
- The resulting executable file must be placed in the directory src/grep/ and named s21_grep





## Part 4. Bonus. Implementation of grep utility flag combinations

Bonus assignment for extra points. You need to develop the grep utility:
- Support of all flags, including their _pair_ combinations (e.g. `-iv`, `-in`)
- Only pcre or regex libraries can be used for regular expressions
- The source, header and make files must be placed in the src/grep/ directory
- The resulting executable file must be placed in the directory src/grep/ and named s21_grep
